# Identify model/variants to process
- Make sure the data exists
- Make sure the time-period splits exist
# For each model/variant/scenario
- Make the model/variant/scenario directories

## For each covariate
- Make the model/variant/scenario/temporary_directories by variable
- Process the raw data into the temporary_directories
  - Reproject
  - Resample
  - Clip to region
  - Convert units

### For each time-period
- Merge together the variable-specific years that go into that time-period
- Move the merged time-period data into the model/variant/scenario/time-period directory
- Clean up temporary_directories
